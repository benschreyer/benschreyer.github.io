I am considering homework problems, trying to understand the solutions. For quantum teleportation, I am realizing, that we still need to classically send information, so it is still limited by the speed of light, is this correct?





Secondly what is flawed about the calculation by the following approach, to send a classical bit instantly:





Share a bell pair between A,B, and A promises to B "by t = T, you will be able to measure your qubit to gain information"





|11> + |00>





A has some information (say the results of the superbowl) they want to share with B, at a known time between both parties (end of the game).





After A knows their bit of information, they prepare a state in |0> or |1>, the bit they wish to encode x.





A applies the following to their qubits CZ (|x>|bell_pair_a>), where CZ is controled Z.





Case: |x> = 0:





State is |0>|00> +|0> |11>, since the CZ did nothing





Case |x> = 1





State is |1>|00> - |1>|11> ( CZ flipped the sign)





Now clearly B can measure their qubit in the +/- basis,


and will gain the bit x, all they have to do is wait long enough that they know A has done the promised operation to their shared pair





B(x = 1) <-> B measures |0> -  |1> = |->


B(x = 0) <-> B measures |0>  + |1> = |+>
