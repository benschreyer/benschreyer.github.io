	<h1>Remote Summer Math and Computer Science Tutoring</h1>
	<h2> About Me</h2>
	<p>I am Benjamin Schreyer, a rising senior at BCC High School.One of my passions is learning about STEM fields in general with a focus towards computer science and Physics. Throughout my time in middle and high school I took on various personal projects related to subjects such as robotics, math, and web development while also challenging myself in school with STEM classes. During the summer of 2018 I taught a student the Python programming language along with useful math to employ in programs and have participated in school clubs where success depended on teaching others as well as learning from them. I enjoy teaching others both because it benefits the student and really tests me on my knowledge of a subject. The rest of this website is a showcase of various personal projects I have made.</p>

	<h2>Math</h2>
		<p>I have completed all the standard math courses for middle and high school students, and feel confident tutoring students taking any class up to Algebra 2. I can create lessons that expand on and review math learned in the previous school year or prepare and introduce students to math they will learn next year. Programming is an extension of math and as a result learning new math can be complemented with programming exercises and vice versa.</p>
	<h2>Computer Science</h2>
		<p>Programming has applications in many subject areas from making a dynamic website to controlling a robot. Below I have listed programming languages I know well and some common applications of these languages. Students can choose to learn a language and apply it to a specific STEM area or just learn a language and the funadmentals of math and computer science needed to make programs.</p>
		<ul>
			<li><h3>Python</h3><p>Python is commonly used to automate management of websites and computer systems as well as by data scientists for easily setting up virtual experiments and is a great language for beginners as Python is very human-readable, can run on any computer, and has many great extensions that provide visual output from programs like a graph or an animation.</p></li>
			<li><h3>HTML, CSS, and Javascript</h3><p>These are the languages of the web which can be used to build familiar things like browser games, social networking sites, or informational pages. I built this <a href="index">website</a> with HTML and CSS in 9th Grade and many <a href= "2dchemicalkinetics.html">web apps to show math and physics concepts.</a>.</p></li>
			<li><h3>Java</h3><p>A common enterprise language that allows programs to run on many types of computers. Minecraft is probably the most well known Java program but things like document editors, calculators, and chat applications <a href="https://benschreyer.github.io/scrumcapture.png">(Example)</a> can also be built with Java and used on computers or smart phones.</p></li>
			<li><h3>C++</h3><p>C++ is a language used in robots and high performance computing. Arduino mini computers run C++ code<a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5NkgEaOPV8">(Example)</a> to control motors, lights, and sensors because of its high speed and ability to work with the input and output data of a robot. Similarly C++ is chosen by many game developers<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT9aD0LOs_g">(Example)</a>(Companies such as Microsoft and Electronic Arts choose C++ for most of their games) and scientists for its speed of execution(Calculating shapes of planetary orbits or the spread of a disease). </p></li>
		
		</ul>

	<p>Obviously this is not an exhaustive list of programming languages or the interesting programs you can write. If your child has interest in a subject not listed I can adapt the learning of a well fitting programming language to complement the subject.</p>
