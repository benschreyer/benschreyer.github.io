	<h1>Arduino Drone</h1>
	<p>After being inspired by the use of control loops to control vehicles in video games i decided to build a drone almost from the ground up. With further PID tuning and adjustment of the control scheme the drone will become fully controllable. For now it is only capable of short periods of hovering.</p>

	<h2>Electronics</h2>
	<p>A total of 3 arduino pro-mini boards were used, all running on 5v at 16MHz. nrf24l01 modules were chosen as they are inexpensive and highly effective. Radio communication between the controller and the flight controller required the use of a dual arduino flight controller. One arduino proccessed the SPI signals from the radio module and turned them into PWM output for the other arduino to read and mix with PID values to determine motor speeds. Yaw, pitch, and roll data were obtained using an mpu 6050 board and Jeff Rowberg's digital motion proccessing library. The flight controllers loop time would be far to high if a single arduino was tasked with both radio communcation and flight calculations. Use of pin change interrupts also allowed for efficent reading of PWM signals from the radio modules.</p>

Black and white wires are connections for motor controllers, the connectors are arranged like the four rotors of the drone making installation hard to mess up. All boards and sub modules were built with interchangibility in mind.</p>

	<h2>Code and PID theory</h2>
	<p>PID systems were first used for automatic steering of ships and are still used today. The three elements of a PID controller are propotional, integral, and derivative. Proportional correction is based on how much error in the system there is at the current time, so if the drone wishes to be level with the horizon but it is currently perpendicular to the horizon the proportional controller will respond with very strong output. The integral element of a PID loop is responsible for long term corrections such as a video camera on one side of the drone causing a slight imbalance of weight. By integrating the error(how many degrees are we from being level with the horizon) the drone can "learn" that it has a weight stuck to its side and will adjust its motor speeds to compensate. The derivative element takes the derivative of the error and uses it to create control output, if the derivative element of a PID loop is very high the controlled variable will be very difficult to change. This is because derivative of error is the rate of change of error, the derivative controller wants the rate of change of the error to be zero. In terms of a drone the error is the angular position, the derivative of position is velocity, therefore in a drone the derivative controller trys to minimize the speed of rotation the drone experiences.Each of these control elements has a tuning parameter that effects the elements power to effect the system. If these tuning parameters are set perfectly the drone should be almost perfectly stable in flight. In reality it takes alot of analysis and tuning to get a set of three parameters that give the drone ease of control and stability. This is why in the below video you can see the drone never fully compensates for imbalance and drifts heavily in the x and z directions. If the parameters were tuned correctly the drone should be able to hover in place with little change in position. The PID system was implemented using the C++ programming language in the arduino development environment.</p>

	<h2>Summary</h2>
	<p>So far this project has been a great learning experience, with a broad range of applied technology topics covered. The physical parts of the drone allowed me to further my skills in wood working, CAD, and use of a 3d printer. After making many different circuit boards for different integrated circuit configurations I have spent hours doing through hole soldering, i can remember how much i struggled to make simple connections and joints at first. Now i can consistently make great solder joints using leaded or non leaded solder. The programming and interfacing of arduinos and other integrated ciruits has given me insights into I2c and SPI communications as well as an understanding of pulse width modulation signals. PWM signals played a large role in the project, along with interfacing between two arduino boards PWM also enabled use of an arduino board to controller the motor's of the drone. The most valuable lesson i learned while building my quadcopter was a very strong understanding of control theory and the math behind it. Before the project i did not even understand what derivatives and integrals are. After I have a full understanding of both and how they effect an open loop system.</p>
	<h1>Javascript and HTML math demos</h1>
	<p>For the past five years i have been creating online demos of math concepts using Javascript control of an HTML canvas. These projects have helped me learn and cement understanding of math in the cartesian space.</p>
	<h2>Projectile Physics Simulation</h2>
	<p>After doing basic projectile motion in algebra class i was inspired to create a more complex and applicable model. In class we had assumed no drag forces and only acceleration due to gravity. I intended to calculate for drag force. At first i thought that a simple function could be used to derive the coordinates of a launched projectile. After doing some math on paper using newtons laws and the drag equation i realised that building said simulation would be more challengeing. Since acceleration is linked to velocity, velocity is linked to drag, and drag is linked to acceleration a circular dependance is present. This means only approximations using infinitecimals can be used to find the approximate position of the object as it flys through the air. By calculating new velocitys and forces every delta seconds an approximation of the objects position can be made, the smaller the time between calculations the more accurate the approximation.</p>

	<h2>Newtonian Gravity Simulations</h2>
	<p>This project was a precursor to the one listed above. About a year and a half earlyer i became interested in the math behind Newtonian Physics. Using the inverse square law and the same simulation on a small time scale to approximate positions of two objects i built two different web apps. Both had the same physics engine, but one employed png textureing to give a more dramatic effect. The physics engine keeps track of the object's mass, velocity, and distance from the other object to calculate the movements of the two objects towards each other due to gravity.</p>

	<h2>Approximating Pi With Infinigons</h2>
	<p>My first interesting HTML/Javascript project. In my middle school geometry class we would used Pi alot, finding the radius or circumfrence of a circle. Being such a prominent value i was confused i did not have any understanding of how to calculate Pi. After doing research online i found a site about Archimede's methods of calcualting Pi by measuring an infinite sided polygon inscribed inside or outside of a circle. Using the sine and cosine functions and HTML canvas functionality i built a web app that will draw a polygon and give an estimate for Pi based off of said polygon. The more sides the polygon has the larger the amount of sides the more precise you get.</p>
