Yea the book is “A Primer of Abstract Mathematics” by Robert B. Ash
Page 38 deals with derangements
But this chapter on counting starts at page 25
The operator to construct the derangements is clearly (E - 1) on the factorial function
Clearly we add the element back, but we might also have a -1 which is because there are f(n - 1) ways where the deranged
element is fixed and the other elements are free to move around it which is just their possible number of permutations

The partial derangement I have here is different than the colloquial use of partial derangements


Can this logic be used on F(n) = H(n) to derange the weak orderings?

A python program to check this is logical for small r,n

import itertools
import math


import scipy.special

def f(n):
    return math.factorial(n)

def count_auto(r,n):
    s= 0
    for i in range(r+1):
        s += ((-1) ** i ) * scipy.special.binom(r,i) * f(n - i)
    return s

def count_manual(r,n):
    it = itertools.permutations(range(n))
    c = 0
    for perm in it:
        flag = False
        for i in range(r):
            if perm[i] == i:
                flag = True
        if not flag:
            c += 1
    return c

N = 10
R = 10
for r in range (0,R):
    for n in range(r, N):
        print(count_auto(r,n), end = "")
